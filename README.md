# RMC_RadarAnalysis



This project aims to develop a weather forecasting tool that can process a folder of radar files as input and generate a CSV file as output. The CSV file will contain the minimum, maximum, and mode values for each factor, including reflectivity, velocity, spectrum width, and power.

          The goal of this weather forecasting tool is to provide meteorologists with a powerful and efficient tool that can help them make more accurate weather predictions. The tool takes a folder of radar files as input, which contain data about reflectivity, velocity, spectrum width, and power of precipitation. The radar data is processed using advanced data processing techniques to extract relevant information and calculate the required parameters.

		The output of the tool is a CSV file that contains the minimum, maximum, and mode values for each factor. This output file provides valuable insights into the weather patterns and helps meteorologists make accurate weather forecasts. The tool uses machine learning and statistical modeling techniques to analyze the data and identify patterns in the weather data. These patterns can then be used to predict future weather conditions based on historical data.

The main objective of this project is to develop a powerful and efficient weather forecasting tool that can assist meteorologists in making accurate predictions. The tool will be user-friendly and will provide easy-to-understand insights into the weather patterns.
